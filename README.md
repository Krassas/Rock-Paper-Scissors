# Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Origin & Goals
I came across the idea for this project while browsing frontend mentor(a site with code challenges), i liked it and decided to implement
it.

# Development
The development for this project included the use of DOM manipulation techniques and event listeners.
The actual JavaScript file has comments describing what is happening, but essentially this is what happens in the background:

1.One of the 3 (Rock, Paper, Scissor) buttons is clicked.
2.The computer then generates a random number that is assigned to Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3.The user’s choice and computer’s choice are checked.
4.The user’s score or the computer’s score is increased by one… or no one’s score (a tie) is raised.
5.Update all the page’s results so the user is aware of what happened.

There are also two buttons, the rules button which displays the rules and the new game button which sets the scores back to zero.

# Design
The main game area has three buttons, rock, paper and scissor. Above that there is the header which contains the logo and the two scores 
counters. Bellow that are the two buttons for the rules and new game.

# Improvements to be Made
Even though the site is responsive, i don't like the way the rules are displayed in certain screen sizes.
There is no max score, i could give the player a way to set a max score. For example, best out of three.
I could also use php to link to a database to store the game results.
